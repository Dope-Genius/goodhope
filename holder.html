        The conceptualization and consequent birth of GoodHope Flourish Foundation(GHFF)
        emanated from the raging desire to  improve the standard of living of our people, especially the indigent,  through quality Education, Accessible Health Care, Reduction of Gender- Based Violence and Maternal/Infant mortality, Enlightenment on Girl-Child Development, Engaging people with Special needs, as well as  Persons Living with Disabilities(PLWD), reducing unemployment to its barest minimum, among others. <br><br>
        Our advocacy is geared toward social, educational and economic empowerment by way of Capacity-building to foster ownership among all individuals in our state, and by extension, our country as a whole. This would positively impact our society, as accountability mechanisms would be put in place for adequate checks and balances.<br><br>
        We are committed to fulfilling our mandate through solid affiliations and partnerships, in line with our goals, objectives and vision for the Foundation.<br>
        <h1 class="high-lighted_text">To inspire hope  and make life worth living and flourishing for all and sundry.</h1></p>
